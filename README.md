# campact_huffman
This project is a final project of Data Structure II in School Technical of Campinas, where i do a Compression Algorithm to make small a text file.

All the code is made by [me](https://github.com/luccastraumer). Some things need a refractory and was the someones code smells but my focus was just do works.
The algorithm is based in Huffman Compression. Using the occurrence of each char in text, and with this is created a Three based in Huffman.


Everthing yo0u will need is a text file and select him, and select the out file.

The logic behind the code, simplificated.
